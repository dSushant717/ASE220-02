## Priyanka Pandit
 - Integrated Bootstrap's modal component to pop up detailed pet information when the "Details" button is clicked on a pet card. This modal includes the pet's breed, type, age, gender, and an image. It also features a dynamically generated button that links to a detailed page for the pet, passing the pet's index as a query parameter for further actions.

 ## Sushant Dahal
 -  added hamsters as pets and made it more fun by putting cute emojis for each type of pet, fixed any problems we had with the app, making sure everything worked well, like the pages you click through and the pop-up details for each pet. 
 - worked with the JSON file, which is where all the pet info is stored, to add new pets and make sure all their details were correct.

 ## Sushant Shrestha
 - Implemented logic to divide the display of pet cards into pages, allowing users to click through "Previous" and "Next" buttons as well as directly select a page number. This feature enhances the user experience by organizing the display of pets and preventing information overload.
